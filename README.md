My name is Azharuddin and I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist student who recently completed a Data Science course where I gained proficiency in technical skills such as Python,
Machine Learning, AI, and more. As a part of my learning journey, I have also completed several projects, which can be found in my GitHub account. I have separated all the projects 
into different repositories based on their respective domains.
